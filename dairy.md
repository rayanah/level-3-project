## Day 2
  Run Sandbox and create Cluster and cofigure it with the project needs, and Work on micro-services DockerFiles and try to push them to dockerHup by Tekton pipelines.
  I have a little conflict in creating secret by yaml file, but I switched to create a secret based on existing Docker credentials by -docker login-. So I start pushing the images and some of them working fine and others I have problem with them 
  half the images

## Day 3
 All the day working completing push images to dockerHup, I have successful pushing all images even the multistage images and so happy to figure it out

## Day 4
 After finish  pushing the images, I decide to test and run the Dockerfiles locally, before continue on unstable ground. Sadly, some images didn't work. So I review all the micro-service dockerfile and go all over the web and figure out the cause of errors in running the Dockerfiles
